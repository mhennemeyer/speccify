MidiSpec
=========

A testing framework like minispec that provides more rspec like functionality.

Features:

  * fast.
  * nested contexts with 'chained' before and after blocks.
  * 'obj.should matcher' syntax.
  * provides an easy way to define matchers. Even complex ones that 
    are taking args and may receive messages.
  * 1.9 compatible.
  * Works well with Rails (requires 'minitest_tu_shim' and 'sudo use_minitest yes')

 Based on Ryan Davis' MiniTest


If using with minitest_tu_shim and rails,
mocha-0.9.4 causes errors.
